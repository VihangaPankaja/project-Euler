# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# a,b,c    a**2+b**2 = c**2    
# m>n>0 in Z   k in Z
# a = k(m**2 - n**2)
# b = k(2mn)
# c = k(m**2 + n**2)
