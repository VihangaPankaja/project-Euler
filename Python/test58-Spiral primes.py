    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, 
    but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; 
    that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, 
    a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, 
?   what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%
