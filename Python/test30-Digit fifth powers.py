    Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
*       1634 = 1‚Å¥ + 6‚Å¥ + 3‚Å¥ + 4‚Å¥
*       8208 = 8‚Å¥ + 2‚Å¥ + 0‚Å¥ + 8‚Å¥
*       9474 = 9‚Å¥ + 4‚Å¥ + 7‚Å¥ + 4‚Å¥

    As 1 = 1‚Å¥ is not a sum it is not included. 
    The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
  
?   Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
